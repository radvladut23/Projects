# Projects
This repository represent all my important work in all this 2 and a half years as a student at the Tehnical Univeristy of Cluj Napoca in the computer science department. I have laerned a lot of programming languages that helped me evolve in this domain, like VisualStudio,  Java, VHDL, and others. I will tell you about all my projects and try to make an idea about the things that I managed to learn from them.

Capitale- this is a project made in highschool to commplete my informatics studies, where I decided to implement an application that helps the user improvize his geography by creating a capital quiz, where the random generator gives you a country and you need to quess it s capital. If you are correct, it will open a google page where you can find a lot of information about that place. I improvized my skills in Visual Code, C# and SQL makeing this project.

Pacman- this project helped me evolve in the Python Programming language, being able to learn code writing and solve errors that made me enjoy using it, because it is very easy to solve problems, it comes with a lot of details about everything and all I learned about it helped me to finish my project. 

Floating Point Calculator- helped me to evolve my hardware learnings.
